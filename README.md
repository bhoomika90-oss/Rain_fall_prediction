📌 Project Title

Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

📖 Introduction

Rainfall prediction plays a very important role in agriculture, water resource management, flood control, and weather forecasting. Accurate rainfall prediction helps farmers plan crops, governments manage water resources, and disaster management teams prepare for floods or droughts.

In this project, we build a Rainfall Prediction System using Machine Learning techniques. The model analyzes historical weather data and predicts whether rainfall will occur based on various weather parameters.

🎯 Objectives

To analyze historical weather and rainfall data

To build a machine learning model for rainfall prediction

To predict rainfall occurrence accurately

To reduce dependency on manual weather analysis

To demonstrate the practical application of ML in real-world problems

🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional rainfall prediction methods are time-consuming and may not provide accurate results due to complex weather patterns. There is a need for an automated system that can predict rainfall efficiently using historical data and machine learning algorithms.

💡 Proposed Solution

We propose a Machine Learning-based Rainfall Prediction System that:

Takes weather-related inputs

Processes historical data

Trains a predictive model

Predicts rainfall occurrence

This system provides faster and more reliable results compared to traditional methods.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical weather data such as:
